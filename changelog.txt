Version: 0.1.2
Date: 15. 11. 2018
  Features:
    - Pipe Highlight tool revamped to be a toggle.
    - Pipe Highlight tool now has setting for maximum distance checked (50-500 tiles). (80 tiles default)
    - Pipeline highlighter tool added. Highlights and assesses any pipeline you select (hover your mouse over) up to the setting limit (100-5000 pipes). (Default 250)
    - Administrator /clear-all-markers command to remove all markers from any player.
    - Two settings that will show orphaned pipe count and/or total pipe count (per player)
  Fixes:
    - Pipe Highlight tool was improperly drawing underground markers into buildings that were not pipes. Now it only draws markers for underground pipes.
    - Clamped pipes were not cooperating with PipeLayer mod. Corrected.
    - Altered internal "Get direction" script logic to be significantly more efficent.

Version: 0.1.0
Date: 11. 10. 2018
  Features:
    - Seperated into its own mod.
    - Pipe cleaner tool. Effectively deletes fluid out of pipes instead of you having to mine every single one.
    - Oprhan finder. When you hover over belts or pipes, it checks around you to see if any underground belts or pipes are missing a connection.
    - Pipe clamps. Automatic clamping allows parallel close proximity pipe laying. Always prevents fluid mix when placing or unclamping pipes manually.
    - Pipe highlighter tool. Highlights all underground connections and pipes-to-ground around you.
